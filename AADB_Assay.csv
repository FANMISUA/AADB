The culture was added with the evaluation medium containing dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (final concentration of DHT: 1 nmol/L) or the evaluation medium containing the compound of Examples or the compound of Comparative Examples (final concentration of the compound of Examples or the compound of Comparative Examples: 5, 14, 41, 123, 370, 1111, 3333, or 10000 nmol/L), followed by culture for 24 hours. Then, the transcription activity value was measured. The transcription activity was measured by using Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). From the measured transcription activity, 50% transcription activity inhibition concentration (IC50 value) was calculated by logistic regression when the transcription activity value obtained by using 1 nmol/L DHT was 100% and the transcription activity value obtained by using the evaluation medium only was 0%.",reporter gene assays,Reporter gene,Other,Antagonist,Homo sapiens,,

864,,"Briefly, the AR LBD is expressed as a fusion with the Gal4 transcription factor, which binds to the Gal4 reporter DNA. Upon activation with agonist hormone (DHT), the Gal-AR LBD binds to the Gal4 reporter gene, which in turn drives the transcription (and subsequently translation) of the reporter luciferase. The effect of antiandrogens (competitive antagonists) on this process is measured by quantifying the amount of luciferase activity after 24 hours in the presence of varying concentrations of antiandrogens. From these values, an IC50 for each antagonist is calculated. Experimentally, Hela cells were maintained in Dulbecco&#39;s modified Eagle&#39;s medium H-21 4.5 g/L glucose, containing 10% steroid depleted fetal bovine serum, 50 units/mL penicillin.
